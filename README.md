# grouper-python

This is a module to interact with the [Grouper Web Services API](https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/display/Grouper/Grouper+Web+Services).

## Installation

To install grouper library only:

``` sh
pip install .
```

To install for development:

``` sh
pip install --editable .[dev]
```

This will install so the `grouper` module is based off the source code,
and also installs neccessary linters and testing requirements.
